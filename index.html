        <p>There are essentially five actions you can take in Minesweeper:
         
            Open a square. This is done simply by left clicking on a square.
            Marking a square as a mine. This is done by right clicking on a square. A little mine icon will show up there.
            Clear any marks. Again, right click on the square. Right clicking cycles through the following states: Bomb, Clear.
            Opening all remaining adjacent squares to a number square. If for example you have a square with the number 1 and you have already marked one mine in one of the adjacent squares you can left click on the 1 square and the remaining adjacent squares will all be opened. This can save a lot of time while trying to quickly clear out squares. If you press on a number where not all adjacent mines have been marked, e.g. the number is 3 and you've only flagged one adjacent square, then the squares will not be opened, to prevent you from accidentally clicking on a number and blowing yourself up! In the old Windows version of this game you used both mouse buttons together to perform this action, but here we just use a normal left-click.
        </p>

        <h3>Winning</h3>
        <p> You've won the game when you've opened all squares that don't contain a mine. If you've opened all the empty/nr squares but haven't flagged the mine squares remaining, they will be auto-flagged and you have won. So, essentially flagging is not required, it's only there to help you keep track of where you think the mines are. The real way to win is open all the non-mine squares. This can be used to gain a tiny bit of speed if you're trying to improve your time :)</p>

        <h4>Support for tablets and phones</h4> 
        <p>If youâ€™re playing on a tablet, mobile phone or other touch device you wonâ€™t be able to right click on the squares. To perform right-click actions you press the square you want to mark and hold until a box pops up showing a flag. If you keep on pressing down, the box will cycle through three states: Flag, Question Mark, Clear. When the box shows the state you want to mark the square with, simply stop pressing down and the square will be marked with that state. </p>
